## Findings

### 1. Pin Creation and Organization
**Problem:** Users found it difficult to organize pins into boards during the pin creation process.

**Fix:** Introduce a more intuitive drag-and-drop interface for organizing pins into boards. Add a step-by-step 
guide or a quick tutorial for first-time users.

### 2. Search Functionality
**Problem:** Users had trouble filtering search results effectively.

**Fix:** Enhance the search interface by adding clear and easily accessible filters (e.g., by content type, board,
or user). Implement a "Save Filter" option for frequent searches.

### 3. Profile Management
**Problem:** Users struggled with editing their profile information and managing privacy settings.

**Fix:** Simplify the profile management interface by consolidating profile and privacy settings into a single,
easy-to-navigate section. Include brief descriptions or tooltips to explain each setting.

### 4. Board Collaboration
**Problem:** Users found it challenging to invite others to collaborate on boards.

**Fix:** Improve the visibility of the "Invite Collaborators" feature by placing it prominently within the board 
interface. Add an instructional prompt or animation to show how to invite others.

## Competitor Analysis

### Snapchat
**Strengths:** Engages users with real-time content through Stories and Spotlight, offering a dynamic way to 
share and discover short-lived visual content. Snapchat’s AR filters and lenses enhance creativity and user 
interaction.

**Weaknesses:** Content on Snapchat is ephemeral, making it less suitable for long-term inspiration or detailed 
content organization. It lacks the robust content curation tools like boards and pins that Pinterest provides,
which are designed for more permanent content discovery and sharing.
